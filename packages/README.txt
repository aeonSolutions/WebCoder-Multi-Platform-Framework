- packages are compressed files such as .sugar files that can be of the following public release types
	 libraries (*.lib.sugar)
	 frameworks (*.framework.sugar)
	 widgets (*.widget.sugar)
	 WebApps (*.wapp.sugar)
	 
- To remember: a library may have dependencies of other frameworks and libraries
- each .sugar needs to have:
	- a version file
	- a deploy file (web; local; mobile;...)
